<h1>CLF Artemis File Server</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="spacer">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="lightgrey">

<p>All the user data and Artemis data are stored on the Artemis File Server.</p>
<p>This webpage explains how to connect to the server and download the data for your experiment.</p>
<p>Users must login using the email address and password which were used to register with the STFC Facilities User Office.</p>
<p>In order to be able to transfer files larger than 50 MB in Windows you must follow the instructions in the section below.</p>

<h2>Increasing the file size limit in Windows 7 and 8.1</h2>
<p>Note: this should be done before connecting to the WebDAV server using the instructions in the <b>'How to connect'</b> section below.</p>

<td class="lightgrey">

<h3>How to increase the limit</h3>
<p>The batch script provided by the Scientific Computing Department at STFC and 
<a href="webdav_files/registry_update.bat">downloadable here</a> 
will do this for you but needs to be run with administrator privileges. </p>
<p>If you are unsure as to whether you have administrator privileges
then you can still download and run the script and you will be able to tell from the error messages.</p>

<p>Click on the link to the batch file above and save it (DON'T RUN IT YET).</p>
<p>Go to the folder containing the the downloaded file 'registry_update.bat', right click on the file and select 'Run as administrator'.</p>
<p>If you get 'Access is denied' errors in the Command Window then you do not have administrator privileges.<p> 
<p>Contact your system administrator to have these privileges added. If this is not possible, then the connection
to the file server will still work but you will get an error whenever you try to access files larger than 50 MB.<p> 
<p>If you get messages in the Command Window reporting that the commands ran successfully, then the registry update has been done successfully.</p>

<h2>How to connect</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="spacer">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="lightgrey">

<h3>Windows 7 and 8.1</h3>
<p>With a 'Windows Explorer' file browser open right-click on 'Computer' (Windows 7) or 'This PC' (Windows 8.1) or 'Network' in the left hand navigation pane then select <b>'Map network drive...'</b> </p>

<img src="webdav_files/map_network_drive_w7_1.png"></img>

<p>Insert <b>https://artemis-test.esc.rl.ac.uk/webdav/</b> into the 'Folder' </p>
<p>Click 'Connect using different credentials' </p>
<p>Click 'Finish' </p>

<img src="webdav_files/map_network_drive_w7_2.png"></img>

<p>Enter your login details into the login box</p>

<ul>
 <li>For Facility Users this is the email address and password which you used to register with the STFC Facilities User Office.</li>
 <li>For Artemis admin users this is your STFC Federal ID (no prefix required) and password.</li>
</ul>   

<p>
Click 'Remember my credentials' if you are logged into Windows using a personal account and want to connect to this file server again in the future.<br>
<b>DO NOT</b> select it if you are using a shared computer or logged into Windows using some kind of shared "guest" account.
</p>

<img src="webdav_files/map_network_drive_w7_3.png"></img>

<p>If the login is successful then you will see the top level 'Artemis' folder as shown below.</p>
<p>Navigate into the Artemis folder and you will see a folder for each experiment which you are associated with.</p>

<h2>Browsing</h2>

<tr>
<td class="spacer">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="lightgrey">

<p>You can browse the directory structure and open files as you normally would in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>You may be re-prompted to enter your login details when opening certain file types.</p>
<p>Facility Users are not able to create, modify or delete any files or folders.</p>

</td>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td class="spacer">&nbsp;</td>
<td class="lightgrey">

<p>If you would like to download files to your local machine, this is done in the usual way.</p>
<p>You can either drag and drop files or folders into a local directory, or copy and paste in the
usual way using either the keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>When downloading folders containing large amounts of data (particularly lots of small files)
this can be a slow process.</p>
<p>For example, an experiment containing around 10 GB of data may take a few hours to download 
depending on your internet connection speed.</p>
<p>You can get an idea of how long a download might take by right clicking on the file or folder
and selecting 'Properties'.</p>
<p>Be aware that whilst the progress bar in the copy dialog box is often quite accurate,
the estimate of remaining time is often very wrong!</p>
